# Spotify UnWrapped
Welcome to Spotify Unwrapped!

We're a clone of Spotify Wrapped, except we are able to be used year-round. Our App enables users to create summaries of listening habits in three different ranges:

- Long Term (Approx. Past Year)
- Medium Term (Approx. Past 6 Months)
- Short Term (Approx. Past Month)

Made by students at Georgia Institute of Technology.
